# Scout Camp

## Best Part of Camp

  The best part of scout camp was the optional bike ride I went on for the last day of camp.Me an some other campers went from camp Matigwa to Madrid which was a 27 mile bike ride. When we got to Madrid we went to a food place and had pancakes and they were good.By the time the ride was over I was exausted because there were really big hills we had to ride up.

## Worst Part of Camp

  The worst part of camp was the mosquitos.I got mosquito bites galore and I was always itching myself and I always felt paranoid that there was a mosquito on me all the time.By the time I got home I had bumps and scratches (from scratching the bites) everywhere especialy my legs.

## Going Home

I was so relieved when my scout leader told the troop we could leave early(we all agreed we wanted to leave early) because i was quite done with all the heat, and mosquitos, and uncomfortable sleeping place. when I got home I went straight to the shower.
